<h1>üç∑ Grapes. - A Wine Library using API's</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Welcome to Grapes, a web application designed to help wine enthusiasts discover, filter, and explore a curated collection of wines from around the world. Whether you're searching for a vintage wine to impress guests or simply trying to broaden your palate, Wine Library offers powerful filtering options by wine type, region, and year. This user-friendly interface allows users to search by name, refine their selection through specific filters, and even receive a random wine suggestion if they're looking for something new.

<h3>Features</h3>
<li>Search by Name or Region: Quickly find wines by typing in part of the wine's name or region.</li>
<li>Wine Type Filters: Filter wines by type (Red, White, Sparkling).</li>
<li>Vintage Filter: Use various buttons to select the year (vintage) and explore wines from different decades.</li>
<li>Region Filter: Select specific regions to narrow down your wine selection.</li>
<li>Random Wine Generator: Can't decide? Let the app suggest a random wine.</li>
<li>Reset Filters: Easily reset your search and start fresh.</li>
